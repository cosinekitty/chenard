Chenard is a free and open source chess program written in C++.
The code is very mature and well-tested (started in 1993).
It is not the strongest AI out there, but it will provide a serious challenge for most people.

Chenard supports the following platforms:

- Windows 32-bit and 64-bit (GUI and command-line).
- [ChenServer](https://github.com/cosinekitty/chenard/wiki/ChenServer) TCP server (provides chess logic outside of C/C++).
- WinBoard plug-in engine.
- Linux xboard plug-in engine.
- Linux command-line.
- Mac OS command-line.
- TTY version for use on serial teletype machines.
