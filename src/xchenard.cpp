    $Log: xchenard.cpp,v $
    Revision 1.29  2009/12/08 22:17:32  don.cross
    Fixed compiler errors about goto skipping over variable initializers.

    Revision 1.28  2009/12/08 21:59:22  Don.Cross
    Fixed embarrassing bugs in XChenard's timing code:
    I was using IsComputersTurn() to figure out whether to adjust the remaining moves in the current time period,
    but this was wrong because it in turn uses TheChessBoard to figure out whose turn it is; but TheChessBoard
    can be in a random state due to being called from the search!  Now the caller figures out whether or not the
    opponent's actual move has been received and recorded.
    Another problem was that I was finding out whose turn it was when I received the "time" command, which is received
    before the opponent's move has arrived!  A similar problem occurs at the beginning of the game, when the
    computer is playing neither White nor Black (yet).
    Also needed to reset the ply counter when the "new" command is received.

    Revision 1.27  2009/09/19 18:04:12  Don.Cross
    Fixed a timing bug that affected XChenard when the hosting software used external opening books:
    XChenard would get confused about how many moves remained in the current time period, and would
    typically lose by burning up all its time.  Instead of trying to keep special-purpose counters up to date,
    we just take a look at how many plies have been made, whether or not we have already received
    the opponent's move, and calculate where we are inside the current time period, if any is in effect.

    Revision 1.26  2009/09/17 17:48:58  Don.Cross
    Added support for the WinBoard 4.4.xx "option" command.
    Used this to implement a custom option for enabling/disabling opening book and training file (chenard.trx).
    On startup, do a one-time check for a file called xchenard.ini and process any options within it.

    Revision 1.25  2009/09/16 16:49:34  Don.Cross
    Added support for the WinBoard/xboard "memory" command to set hash table sizes.

    Revision 1.24  2008/12/10 19:00:32  Don.Cross
    Minor fixes to make Linux g++ warnings go away.

    Revision 1.23  2008/12/07 02:43:09  Don.Cross
    Learned how to use Profile Guided Optimization, thanks to a conversation with Jim Ablett on the WinBoard forum.
    Modified xchenard.exe to have a "-self" option to assist in the profiling step required by PGO.
    Also tweaked optimizations used in winchen.exe.
    I discovered that I had not enabled optimizations for xchenard.exe!
    Until I figure out how to automate PGO builds, webpack.bat will not auto-build the source code by default.

    Revision 1.22  2008/12/05 22:52:34  Don.Cross
    I received reports that people using Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition were getting compiler errors in winchen.rc.
    It turns out that Express Edition does not ship all the header files that are available in the professional edition that I use.
    I fixed winchen.rc to remove dependency on these include files.

    Fixed a theoretical bug I discovered while reviewing the source code for XChenard:
    I was using centiseconds instead of seconds to budget time when there was less than 2 seconds left on the clock.
    This could have caused XChenard to let its flag drop, although I have never seen this happen.

    Revision 1.21  2008/11/23 21:25:26  Don.Cross
    I have noticed in playing xchenard vs xchenard, with pondering enabled, on my machine with 2 CPUs,
    WinBoard often has a hard time displaying the moves promptly because of all the CPU usage.
    I am trying out an idea: before pondering, sacrifice 0.35 seconds to sleep, so that WinBoard gets some time.

    Revision 1.20  2008/11/23 20:00:21  Don.Cross
    Fixed compiler error in Linux version of xchenard:  forgot to include stdarg.h for dprintf().
    I had a redundant include of stdlib.h instead of stdarg.h.
    I don't know why this compiled in Windows!

    Revision 1.19  2008/11/23 19:41:55  Don.Cross
    When we are pondering, and are about to display best path, check to see if we have already received
    the opponent's move that we were predicting.  If so, we should NOT include that move in the best path displayed,
    because it is no longer a hypothetical move.  In other words, from xboard's point of view, we are no longer pondering,
    but thinking about an actual position.
    Fixed bugs that caused MyRemainingMoves to not be in sync with the correct value.
    Worked on TimeBudgetForNextMove so that it does not let the time fall dangerously low.
    I have seen WinBoard display (!) after the time when it falls below one second, which just looks scary!

    Revision 1.18  2008/11/22 20:31:53  Don.Cross
    Tweaked TimeBudgetForNextMove to be more generous with the think time, and more so when pondering is enabled.

    Revision 1.17  2008/11/22 16:27:32  Don.Cross
    Massive overhaul to xchenard: now supports pondering.
    This required very complex changes, and will need a lot of testing before release to the public.
    Pondering support made it trivial to implement the "hint" command, so I added that too.
    Pondering required careful attention to every possible command we could receive from xboard,
    so now I have started explicitly sending back errors for any command we don't understand.
    I finally figured out how to get rid of the annoying /WP64 warning from the Microsoft C++ compiler.

    Revision 1.16  2008/11/21 03:16:45  Don.Cross
    I realized I could just call ComputerChessPlayer::getPredictedOpponentMove() instead of having to override a virtual method.
    It returns a move where dest==0 if there is no prediction.  This is much simpler!

    Revision 1.15  2008/11/21 03:05:16  Don.Cross
    First baby step toward pondering in xchenard: used a hack in the Chenard engine that supports multithreaded pondering in WinChen.
    We are not doing pondering the same way, but the hack allows us to share the part of WinChen that predicts the opponent's move.
    Did some other refactoring of code that may help finish pondering, but I'm still trying to figure out what I'm really going to do.

    Revision 1.14  2008/11/20 23:13:49  Don.Cross
    Now dprintf is a true function instead of a macro hack, and it prefixes its output with a "#" and time stamp.

    Revision 1.13  2008/11/20 02:55:53  Don.Cross
    Improved time management: use 'time' messages from xboard to know how much time it thinks we have left on our clock.
    Do some simple math on the value to move faster when time is running out.
    Also, be a little more careful with xboard protocol: check for accepted/rejected on feature requests that matter to us.
    Added a dprintf macro for debug prints when "feature debug=1" is accepted, but so far the WinBoard I am using doesn't accept it.

    Revision 1.12  2008/11/18 21:48:36  Don.Cross
    XChenard now supports the xboard commands post and nopost, to enable/disable display of thinking.

    Revision 1.11  2008/11/18 19:54:53  Don.Cross
    Fixed a really annoying bug: if the opponent played Black and tried to promote a pawn,
    XChenard would reject the move, saying it was illegal!  Now pawn promotion works for both White and Black opponents.

    Revision 1.10  2008/11/15 16:44:55  Don.Cross
    Fixed a bug I found in testing:  in the new Windows dual-threaded code, I was forgetting to trim the '\n' from the end of the input lines.

    Revision 1.9  2008/11/15 03:04:06  Don.Cross
    I think I have figured out how to make the Windows version of XChenard handle the "?" command
    for making a move immediately.  Needs more testing.  Basically I have conditional code for Linux or Windows.
    In Linux, I use the select() command as before, but now in Windows I start up a dedicated thread for
    processing lines of input from stdin and enqueuing them.  The main chess engine thread can enter a critical
    section and inspect the queue at any time to see if one or more lines of input is waiting.
    Needs more testing on Windows, and I also need to see if this will still compile and run correctly on Linux.
    Checking in tonight to back up my work before I go to bed.

    Revision 1.8  2008/11/06 22:25:07  Don.Cross
    Now ParseFancyMove accepts either PGN or longmove (e7e8q) style notation only.
    We tolerate of check '+' or checkmate '#' characters being absent or extraneous in the input.
    The former is especially important because I often see PGN notation where '+' is missing on checking moves.
    To allow for PGN input, I had to allow avoidance of the PromotePawn callback, so other code was changed as well.
    Version numbers are now always constently yyyy.mm.dd across all builds of Chenard!

    Revision 1.7  2008/11/02 22:23:02  Don.Cross
    Made tweaks so I can use xchenard to generate endgame databases.
    No longer disable SIGTERM and SIGINT: this had the effect of making it so I could not Ctrl+C to kill xchenard!
    These are no longer needed because I send back the feature commands to request xboard not doing that.

    Revision 1.6  2008/11/02 21:04:28  Don.Cross
    Building xchenard for Win32 console mode now, so I can debug some stuff.
    Tweaked code to make Microsoft compiler warnings go away: deprecated functions and implicit type conversions.
    Checking in with version set to 1.51 for WinChen.

    Revision 1.5  2008/11/02 20:04:13  Don.Cross
    xchenard: Implemented xboard command 'setboard'.
    This required a new function ChessBoard::SetForsythEdwardsNotation.
    Enhanced ChessBoard::PositionIsPossible to check for more things that are not possible.
    Fixed anachronisms in ChessBoard::operator== where I was returning 0 or 1 instead of false or true.

    Revision 1.4  2008/11/02 02:01:33  Don.Cross
    Added support for 'undo' and 'remove' commands.
    Figured out how to avoid the long delay during startup: xboard waits a while for more options,
    but if you specify "feature done=1" it immediately proceeds.
    Enabled ping command to avoid documented race conditions.

    Revision 1.3  2008/11/01 21:55:32  Don.Cross
    Xboard force move command '?' is working.
    Chenard can now play White or Black.
    Crude ability to obey the 'level' command for think time.

    Revision 1.2  2008/11/01 19:01:11  Don.Cross
    The Linux/xboard version of Chenard is starting to work!
    Right now it only knows how to play Black.
    There are a lot more xboard commands it needs to understand in order to be fully functional.

    Revision 1.1  2008/11/01 16:18:49  Don.Cross
    The beginning of an xboard version of Chenard for Linux.
